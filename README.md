## The latest development for the project is going on in the hackathon branch.

## Project Idea Description  : 

### Team Name : DeepSpace 9
### Team Members : 
- Abhinav (Team Lead)
- Harshit Gaur 
- Kundanika Pradhan
- Abhinash Bhengra
- Vividh Pandey

## Challenge Name : Near Space, Near You
### Objective of the Challenge 
Our challenge is to develop a lesson-plan and bill of materials (BOM) to teach students how to build a low-cost HAB capable of reaching near-space. For this purpose, we are assuming “near-space” as the Earth’s atmosphere between 20 kilometers and 100 kilometers above sea level. The lesson-plan shall include 5 main parameters:
- Planning
- Preparation
- Launch
- Tracking 
- Recovery of a HAB

Idea  : The idea is to create an Android based app which can serve as the one stop solution from which the students can learn the following things : 
- Fundamentals of a HAB
- Design the experiments using the guidelines and Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Build the HAB
- Testing
- Apply the correct retrieval / recovery procedure
- Conduct scientific experiments from data collected
- Comparing it with real world model and expand their knowledge

This app will be interactive and intuitive, designed in such a way that follows the best teaching pedagogy and can be considered as a standalone resource. It will help the students learn the community guidelines and follow government protocols involved in launching a high altitude balloon.

We will provide all the resources that the students might require during or before the experiment. The app will also help them set the outline and budget of the overall activity.

Implementation : The Android app will be developed using Kotlin. The app will be based on interactive designs and illustrative resources.
Flow : The app will follow a module based design which will be based on research content and distribute the content in easy to understand lessons.
Mentorship : Help the students connect to different space agency and communities.
Bill of Materials (BOM) : All the equipment (like the payload, parachute and balloon) will have a detailed and specific description. Students can directly purchase the material required to build a balloon using certain global e-commerce links or global vendors. It will help them set the budget of the experiment and design the outline accordingly.
